  ⚠️FOR EDUCATIONAL PUPOSES ONLY!!!⚠️  
  
this project was created out of pure boredom while working on a school laptop. (no I haven't used it.)

this scrypt creates a number of BMP files at high speeds with random colours. the average file size is 136mb and it can create multiple per second. The scrypt also gives each one a different folder so it lags the computer more. right now the cap is set to about 231gb of images but this can be easily edited by editing the:
`num_images` variable. Just add one for every 136mb.

# what to import:
make sure to install pillow(PIL) and numpy, by using `pip install pillow` and `pip install numpy`

have fun with this scrypt!!!
Note: the scrypt is so unreadable on purpose for... copy... reasons. If you want a version that is readable look at DONTRUNbetter.py
